## **Presentations on Sunday at 9:30 AM**

* What did you create?

* Describe your process!

* Where do you see room for improvement?
* Are their benefits for Technology, Law and Society researchers?
* What are the larger societal implications of this technology?

## Important to Keep in Mind During The Hackthon

* Be inclusive.
* This is more than programming exercise!
* Look for ways to relate it your research, even if you feel constrained by code.
* Request assistance when stuck.
* Build projects and friendships that will carry on outside of the TLS Summer Institute.
